# CPSC 304 project_93 Group (Makafui Amouzouvi, Linh Pham, Nilay Mankala)

## Description

The project is a web page that allows a supplier company to manage deliveries to customers. There are different sections of the web page that categorize different components of the supplier’s operations (Deliveries, Customers, Payments, and Warehouses). In each separate page, a main database is displayed (e.g. on the “Deliveries” page, the “Delivery” table is the main one being shown), and there are different useful operations that can be performed on each page corresponding to the tables displayed. For instance, on the “Customers” page, there is a form to add a new Business customer to the database. On the “Deliveries” page, specific queries related to deliveries can be performed by clicking a button.
The project has accomplished the goal of making commonly performed tasks and queries for a supplier database easier to execute and read.
